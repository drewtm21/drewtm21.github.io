          <p class="description">Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? In this podcast episode, The Crew (Travis, Torrin, Drew, Erland, and Jack) discuss the iconic cartoon show SpongeBob SquarePants. When it comes to SpongeBob, there are three main areas of discussion that contribute to its continued relevance today: appeal via incorporation of grown up topics, appeal via character development, and SpongeBob in culture. Over the course of the episode, we will be discussing specific show episodes and playing a bit of trivia to test our (and your) knowledge of SpongeBob. Are you ready kids? I can’t hear you!<a href="https://soundcloud.com/torrin-conrath/engl-3844-panthers-podcast?si=d014b077a86e430eb18f61f8fbf256dd&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing"> Click here to listen!</a>
